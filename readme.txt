= WordPress Missed Scheduled Posts Publisher =

Checks to see if any scheduled posts have been missed. If so, it publishes them. Choose run time and forget it.

This plugin provides a reliable way of scheduling posts on low-traffic sites where the standard method isn't always accurate due to low visitor numbers and / or high update frequency.

The default Wordpress method of scheduling posts is to check if something's waiting to be published each time a visitor comes to the site, but if enough time has passed between visitors then items in the queue can get 'stale' and are flagged as 'missed schedule' instead of being published.

Do you have a web site or blog with a small number of daily visitors?

This plugin provides a simple and effective way of scheduling post updates when the standard Wordpress mechanism isn't enough.

It's very simple to use, doesn't impact bandwidth or analytics.
