== Description ==
= WordPress Missed Scheduled Posts Publisher =

Never miss a scheduled post again! This plugin ensures your scheduled posts are published on time, even on low-traffic websites.

== Why Use This Plugin? ==
By default, WordPress relies on visitor activity to trigger scheduled posts. If your site has low traffic or long gaps between visits, some posts may end up with a "Missed Schedule" status instead of being published.

Missed Scheduled Posts Publisher runs automatically at your chosen interval, ensuring all scheduled posts go live as expectedâ€”without requiring manual intervention.

== Key Features: ==
âœ… Automatically publishes missed scheduled posts
âœ… Customizable execution timeâ€”set it and forget it
âœ… Ideal for low-traffic blogs and websites
âœ… Lightweightâ€”wonâ€™t impact bandwidth or analytics

Simply install, configure, and let the plugin handle the rest! ðŸš€

1. Click Install Now, then Activate the plugin.

You can update the settings anytime from the plugin settings page.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =
This plugin detects and automatically publishes scheduled posts that WordPress failed to publish due to the "Missed Schedule" issue.

= Why do scheduled posts sometimes fail to publish? =
WordPress relies on site visits to trigger scheduled tasks. If thereâ€™s low traffic or long gaps between visits, scheduled posts may be missed. This plugin ensures posts are published on time by running at a set interval.

= How often does the plugin check for missed posts? =
You can set the execution interval from the plugin settings. Options include 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, or 60 minutes.

= Does this plugin slow down my website? =
No. The plugin is lightweight and only runs a quick database check at the defined interval. It does not affect site performance or analytics.

= Does it work with custom post types? =
Currently, the plugin only checks and publishes standard WordPress posts (post post type). Future updates may include support for custom post types.

= Can I use this plugin on a high-traffic website? =
Yes, but it is primarily designed for low-traffic websites where WordPressâ€™s default scheduling system may fail.

= How do I configure the plugin? =
Go to Settings > Missed Schedule Post Publisher, choose your preferred interval, and save. Thatâ€™s it! The plugin will take care of the rest.

= Does this plugin require WP-Cron? =
No, it does not rely on WP-Cron. Instead, it triggers based on visitor activity, ensuring missed posts are checked and published when a user visits your site.

= Is this plugin compatible with caching plugins? =
Yes. However, if your caching plugin aggressively caches pages, ensure that database queries are not cached, so the plugin can detect missed posts in real-time.

= What should I do if the plugin isnâ€™t working? =
* Ensure your scheduled posts have a "Missed Schedule" status.
* Check the plugin settings to confirm the execution time.
* Disable any conflicting plugins that may interfere with post publishing.
* If the issue persists, try deactivating and reactivating the plugin.
